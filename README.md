# BookBot â€“ Character and Word Counter

**BookBot** is a Python program that analyzes text files (books) and provides:  
- Total **word count**  
- **Character count** (letters only, ignoring non-alphabetical characters)  
- **Frequency report of each character**, sorted from most to least frequent  

This project was **inspired by a project from my Bootcamp (Boot Dev)**, where I learned Python basics, file handling, and text processing.
